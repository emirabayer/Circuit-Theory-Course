This lab involves designing a band-pass filter with specific frequency and gain specifications for a 50â„¦ load. In the software part, students simulate the filter, ensuring it meets the requirements for central frequency, passband width, and attenuation. The hardware part focuses on building the filter, tuning LC components, and measuring the frequency response to validate the design against the simulated results.
