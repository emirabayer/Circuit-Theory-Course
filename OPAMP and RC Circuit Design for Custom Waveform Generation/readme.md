This lab involves designing a circuit using OPAMPs and RC components to generate a specific voltage waveform from a square pulse input. In the software part, students simulate the circuit in LTspice using the LM324 OPAMP model, ensuring the output matches key points within Â±10% error. The hardware part requires building the circuit with LM324 ICs, measuring input/output waveforms, and verifying results within given error rate.
