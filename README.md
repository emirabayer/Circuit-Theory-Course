## Lab 1 - Time and Frequency Domain Analysis of RL and OPAMP Circuits
This lab explores both time-domain and frequency-domain analyses of RL and OPAMP circuits. Using LTSpice, students simulate circuits, generate Bode plots, and study OPAMP behavior. The hardware part involves building the circuits, measuring outputs, and comparing results with simulations to validate time and frequency domain concepts.

## Lab 2: - High Voltage Spike Generation
This lab focuses on designing a passive linear circuit to generate high voltage spikes (20V ≤ Vp ≤ 25V) from a 10V peak-to-peak square wave. Using SPICE, students simulate the circuit to verify spike generation with a FWHM < 100ns. In the hardware part, the circuit is implemented, and measurements of spike amplitude and duration are compared with simulation results.

## Lab 3: - OPAMP and RC Circuit Design for Custom Waveform Generation
This lab involves designing a circuit using OPAMPs and RC components to generate a specific voltage waveform from a square pulse input. In the software part, students simulate the circuit in LTspice using the LM324 OPAMP model, ensuring the output matches key points within ±10% error. The hardware part requires building the circuit with LM324 ICs, measuring input/output waveforms, and verifying results within given error rate.

## Lab 4: - Maximum Power Transfer Design
This lab focuses on designing passive linear circuits to achieve maximum power transfer from a 50Ω source to a 180Ω load at 5-10 MHz. In the software part, students simulate and verify maximum power transfer using theoretical calculations. The hardware part involves building the circuits, measuring power dissipation, and comparing results with simulations to validate the design.

## Lab 5: - Band-Pass Filter Design
This lab involves designing a band-pass filter with specific frequency and gain specifications for a 50Ω load. In the software part, students simulate the filter, ensuring it meets the requirements for central frequency, passband width, and attenuation. The hardware part focuses on building the filter, tuning LC components, and measuring the frequency response to validate the design against the simulated results.
